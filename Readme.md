## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shegezzy/alx_be_python.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd alx_be_python

# Make scripts executable (if needed)
chmod +x *.py
```

### Running the Code

Each directory contains specific exercises and projects. Navigate to the relevant folder and run:

```bash
# For Python scripts
python3 filename.py

# For executable scripts
./filename.py
```

## 📖 Learning Objectives

By working through this repository, you will understand:

- How to use Python interpreter and write Python scripts
- How to implement control flow with loops and conditional statements
- How to define and call functions with various parameter types
- How to work with data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
- How to handle exceptions and debug code
- How to implement object-oriented programming principles
- How to work with modules and packages
- How to read from and write to files

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**: Primary programming language
- **Git**: Version control
- **Ubuntu/Linux**: Development environment
- **vim/emacs**: Text editors (as per ALX requirements)

## 📋 Code Style

All code follows:
- **PEP 8**: Python style guide
- **Pycodestyle**: Code style checker
- **ALX coding standards**: Specific requirements for the program

```bash
# Check code style
pycodestyle filename.py
```

## 🧪 Testing

Some projects include test files. Run tests using:

```bash
# Run specific test
python3 -doctest -v filename.py

# Run all tests in a directory
python3 -m doctest *.py
```
